First of all, the Martinez is actually the predecessor to the Martini, which is widely considered the greatest cocktail ever to be poured. The Martinez plays to a much older style though.

The stories laying claim to its creation are as numerous and as colorful as the spectrum of Margarita variations floating around bars today. In many of those stories the drink is named after a woman. In 1945, Jose Cuervo, began running an ad campaign with the slogan, “Margarita: It's more than just a girl's name.” The campaign was a huge success, and the Margarita went on to become one of America's favorite cocktails. The Margarita is a derivative of a family of drinks called Daisies, and in one story, a bartender creates the Margarita accidentally by mistakenly grabbing a bottle of tequila while preparing a Brandy Daisy. According to legend, the customer was delighted with the result, and spread the news far and wide. The bartender decided to call his drink a “Margarita” which is Spanish for “Daisy”.",1960

In the small town of Daïquiri in 1898, Jennings Stockton Cox, an American engineer, led one of the earliest efforts to exploit Cuba's iron-ore mines. As recompense for leaving his secure position in the US, Cox was given generous wages and a ration of Bacardí Carta Blanca. According to legend, Cox was running low on gin one evening while entertaining guests, so he mixed up a punch with limes, sugar, and rum. Cox and his team took to drinking this new concoction and dubbed it the Daiquiri in honor of the city where they lived. The recipe eventually made its way back to the States and became a mainstay for cocktail bars.

Recipes began appearing in multiple publications in the year 1922. Widely considered to be one of the best cocktails of all time, the Sidecar is a very delicate balance of sweet and sour against the earthy backdrop that brandy provides. Recently, some bartenders have even begun making Bourbon Sidecars by substituting bourbon for the brandy. There are generally two different schools of thought when it comes to proportions in the Sidecar. The French school leans toward all three parts in equal amounts, while the English school calls for twice the amount of brandy. Both are fine, but the former tends to hide a lot of the brandy's flavor nuances. Therefore, we'll stick with the Brits on this one.",1935

Dale DeGroff is generally credited with standardizing the additional step of muddling the fruits and spirits, making for an exceptionally fresh-tasting drink. These cocktails are fairly flexible as far as ingredients go, so always opt for something seasonal. The Fruit is largely responsible for the flavor here, so the riper, the better.

The Brandy Crusta is essentially a healthy dose of brandy seasoned with mere dashes of other flavoring ingredients. This style of drink allows the drinker to really appreciate the base spirit without being overwhelmed by its potency. Perhaps the most impressive part of this cocktail is its lemon-shell garnish. Getting it right can take a bit of effort, but it's worth the trouble. If you're having trouble getting it to stay in place, try frosting the rim of the glass and the lemon peel and then letting them sit until a hard crust is formed.

The name, which is an allusion to Greek mythology, translates to Elysian Fields. This was the place where righteous souls were believed to go after death to continue living blessed and happy lives, and hopefully drinking these. This heavenly concoction seems to have first appeared the Harry Craddock's 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book, though little else is known about it's history.

The Peruvian version is a bit more complex and has some added depth, so we'll stick with it.

In keeping with their southern hospitality, the artillery members and their wives threw together what they had on hand and created this punch, which they then served at a ball in the president's honor.

Hugo Ensslin first published the recipe for this lovely little libation in his Recipes for Mixed Drinks in 1916, combining gin, lemon juice, maraschino and crème de violette liqueurs. Unfortunately maraschino and crème de violette weren't exactly commonplace on most bar shelves at the time, so the Aviation had a shaky takeoff. Eventually, crème de violette disappeared entirely from the American market, resulting in a mouth-puckering variation of the original recipe. When it finally reappeared some 40 years later, the Aviation was revived. Crème de violette adds a delicate floral note, which balances the tartness of the healthy dose of citrus and gin.",1935

Different base spirits can be substituted to yield different kinds of Bucks, a dash of your favorite liqueur can be added for some extra zing, or ginger beer can be used in place of ginger ale for hardcore ginger fans. Although this cocktail has disappeared from most contemporary cocktail menus, it is the predecessor to many of today's favorites, including the Moscow Mule, which introduced vodka to the American market in the middle of the 20th century.

Gin's botanicals are a perfect compliment to ginger's spicy bite, and mint exponentially increases this drink's cooling power. The trickiest part to making a great Gin Gin Mule is finding the right kind of ginger beer—and no, ginger ale won't do. If you're using a sweeter ginger beer, you might want to cut back on the simple syrup, but the most important factor is the spice.

It seems that Voronoff, who was seeking a medical method of rejuvenation performed several experiments in which he grafted tissue from the naughty bits of monkeys onto humans.

The use of real grenadine will really pop against the backdrop created by the orange juice, and will help highlight the sweeter notes of the gin.

There, he ordered his favorite drink, an Americano, but requested that the bartender liven it up a bit by replacing the soda water with gin. The bartender also replaced the Americano's traditional lemon slice with an orange slice and named the drink after the Count.  For years, the Negroni was an Italian favorite, but it didn't leave home until well into the 21st century. A full-throttle cocktail renaissance had opened Americans back up to the taste of gin and bitters, so the moment was finally right for the Negroni to make it's way to America, where it has become a mainstay on cocktail menus everywhere.",1964

The recipe was first published in Esquire's Handbook for Hosts in 1949, but no one is quite sure exactly where it came from.

These brightly colored concoctions quickly made their way across the Atlantic and rose in popularity until Prohibition stamped them out in the US. It wasn't until 1957 that blue drinks made their way back into American pop culture, when Harry Yee created the Blue Hawaiian at the Hilton Hawaii Village in Waikiki.

It was a commonly mixed with Cuban rum—usually Bacardí—and a squeeze of lime. During the Second World War, American spirits were scarce outside the military, and the only substitute imported in substantial quantities was Caribbean rum. Due to the rationing of sugar, there were few products to mix with alcohol aside from Coca-Cola. Thus, the Cuba Libre surged in popularity. The harsh truth is that after Coca-Cola removed some of its more dubious components in 1903, we'll never know what the original Cuba Libre was like.

On the way out, he noticed the bartender preparing a large batch of Daiquiris and, not wanting to miss out on an opportunity, decided to try one. He told the bartender that he preferred his Daiquiris with no sugar and twice the normal dose of rum. The bartender made one as requested and named it after him. After the double dose of rum, the story gets a little fuzzy. Perhaps the bartender wasn't quite satisfied with the drink and decided to doctor it up with Maraschino and grapefruit juice.

The Gosling family, who owns the rights to this recipe, began dabbling in rum in Bermuda in the 1860s. Their experimentation resulted in a distinctly rich, dark rum that they would eventually christen “Gosling's Black Seal”. Around the same time, British sailors began brewing beer on the island using ginger root, which was said to cure seasickness. Eventually, someone had the grand idea to mix the two together, and the Dark ‘n' Stormy was born.

In the 1920s, Chicago was a city under violent gang rule. Three bootleggers controlled the city, and a hard line was drawn between North and South Chicago. On the North Side, people drank gin and ginger ale, which, consequently, is called a North Side cocktail. South Side mobsters didn't have as much access to quality liquor and were forced to use stronger flavors to mask the taste of bad gin. The Southside cocktail is an example of one of the most successful recipes for doing just that. There are a couple of fun spins on this cocktail as well. Try adding soda water and serving it over ice for a Southside Fizz, or stick with the coupe and add a healthy dose of champagne for a Southside Royale.",1935

You may have heard of a John Collins, a Charlie Collins, or others, but the Tom Collins is arguably the most famous. Perhaps this is due to America's past penchant for gin. Whatever the cause, the Tom Collins is one of those timeless mixtures of simple, pure ingredients, coming together to yield a delicious cocktail. According to legend, a waiter named John Collins at Limmer's Old House in London unwittingly lent his name to a popular drink made with Holland gin. From there, someone decided to experiment a little and switched the Holland gin out for Old Tom Gin. The name got changed accordingly, and several others followed suit with their own variations.

It's part of a family of cocktails from the late 18th and early 19th centuries that Jerry Thomas might have referred to as “fancy martinis”—gin, vermouth, bitters, a dash of maraschino, and occasionally a little absinthe. Interestingly enough, in Daly's Bartenders' Encyclopedia from 1903, the Tuxedo recipe calls for Maple Gin, which, apparently, was dry gin sweetened with a drizzle of maple syrup. Apparently Daly was alone in his passion for maple gin, as it doesn't really seem to turn up anywhere else. Over the next several years, the Tuxedo continued to evolve with snapshots being taken from time to time in the form of written recipes. The more eccentric ones included sherry, which yielded an exceptionally dry, nutty cocktail. The maraschino and absinthe do a much better job of balancing the gin and vermouth, so we recommend sticking with them.",1935

Bond is infamous for his drinking habits, and indulges in everything from Dom Pérignon to Heineken. This tasty tipple is a sort of dressed up martini. When 007 specifies the contents of the Vesper in Casino Royale, he asks the bartender to use Kina Lillet, an apéritif wine from the Bordeaux region of France. Kina Lillet is no longer manufactured as the company altered its recipe in 1986 to create Lillet Blanc, a similar but less bitter version of their previous product. Many cocktail experts will suggest Cocchi Americano as the closest cousin to Kina Lillet, so use whichever you prefer. Why Mr. Bond prefers his Vesper shaken is a bit of a mystery.

The reasoning behind the name, which means the devil, is unclear. Perhaps it is a reference to its vivid red color or to the spicy notes imparted by the ginger beer. Crème de cassis, which is made from blackcurrants helps soften the ginger beer's bite and round out the flavor, and both harmonize well with the tequila.

In it, the vagabond bon vivant tells a story about wandering from bar to bar in Mexico City in 1937 and finally discovering this cocktail at a bar called La Cucaracha.

Supposedly, the bar began as a speakeasy with the password “Storm's brewin'”—perhaps foretelling the creation of this cocktail. It would appear that Mr. O'Brien came up with the Hurricane in an effort to empty his stores of the large quantities of rum that his southern distributors required him to buy, hence the ample dosing of both light and dark rum. He poured his new concoction into glasses shaped like hurricane lamps and dubbed it the Hurricane. This cocktail is sticky-sweet and bursting with juicy flavors. Be careful though. It packs a category-five punch.",1974

Yankees were the Puritan, Sabbath-keeping New Yorkers who liked to go to bed early and refrain from worldly pleasures. Knickerbockers were the antithesis of that. It's fitting really that there should be a cocktail named after them. The Knickerbocker Special is another great summer drink with a much more lush flavor profile than most other rum-based cocktails.  The grenadine provides a much darker taste and balances out the citrus, which tends to dominate in many drink recipes. If you really want to channel the Knickerbockers, try replacing the grenadine with raspberry syrup for an old school twist.",1935

Then again, thanks to the dark days of Prohibition, American cocktail-enthusiasts have a very special relationship with Cuba. Not so long ago, Cuban rum was barely palatable. Even Cubans themselves had to find ways to mask its noxious funk in order to drink it. Farmers would take whatever they had on hand to make their rum go down more easily, and often what they had on hand were the ingredients to what we now know as the Mojito. As Prohibition spread across America, Havana became our favorite offshore bar. The drinks of the Cuban working class made their way to the capital and into the hands of thirsty American tourists who would later recreate them at home. It's a well-know fact that bartenders today have a love-hate relationship with the Mojito, but it remains, nevertheless, an undeniable classic.",2012

The actual recipe calls for light rum, which will provide a light, clean flavor profile. But this drink is easy to experiment with.

Either way, the fact is that the three different types of rum in this drink make it a little freaky to say the least.

The Cosmo as we know it became popular in gay culture during the 70s and 80s and was picked up by a bartender at the Odeon in Manhattan in 1987. The Odeon was a well-known celebrity watering hole and was frequented by a number of stars. The Cosmo then made its way to the Rainbow Room, where Madonna famously posed with one.

Martin bought the rights to Smirnoff vodka for Heublein Spirits in the late 30s. He had a difficult time selling it though, and decided to partner up with Jack Morgan, owner of the British pub Cock ‘n' Bull in Los Angeles, who, incidentally, was having trouble selling off the large stock of ginger beer he had recently purchased. The two collaborated and came up with this simple, yet refreshing recipe, which ignited the vodka craze of the 50s and would later lead bartenders to create every kind of “Mule” imaginable.",1957

The White Russian was first documented in the mid 60s. From there it experienced a brief surge in popularity during the disco era, but fell out of favor until the release of the film The Big Lebowski in 1998, in which the character played by Jeff Bridges downs eight White Russians and drops a ninth one on the floor.

Second, use freshly squeezed, unsweetened juice to maximize the crisp, tart flavors needed to achieve a well-balanced drink. An egg white is always a welcome addition and will help to smooth out the boldness of these flavors as well.

Simplicity of design, however, was still very much at the core of all
drinks. The Manhattan appears to have come onto the scene about 1882, at which time it was mentioned that a cocktail made from just whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters was coming into vogue. It went by not only ""Manhattan"", but also ""Turf Club Cocktail"" and ""Jockey Club Cocktail"". The ""Manhattan"" moniker almost certainly comes from the Manhattan

Being such an old potable, W L Weller with it's long history as a proper Kentucky Bourbon, is a perfect fit.  The wheated recipe bring a wonderful mellow flavor to the drink, and as it melts, the drink transforms into something reminiscent of mint sweet tea. ","Pour syrup into silver julep cup, silver mug, or Collins glass. Fill with shaved or crushed ice and add bourbon. Stir until glass is heavily frosted, adding more ice if necessary. (Do not hold glass with hand while stirring.) Garnish with mint so that the tops are about 2 inches above rim of glass. Use short straws so that it will be necessary to bury nose in mint, which is intended for scent rather than taste.",13,"The Mint Julep has been the official drink of the Kentucky Derby for almost a century now, and the fastest two minutes in sports just wouldn't feel right without a frosted silver cup in one hand. The origins of this drink predate the Derby by several centuries though. Like many of its cousins, the Julep was originally drunk for medicinal purposes. The name comes from the Arabic word julab and the Persian word gulab, which both translate to “rosewater”. In the early days of America, people made juleps with a number of spirits including rum and brandy, but history seems to suggest that the original julep was actually made with cognac. At the time, bourbon was reserved mostly for poor southerners who couldn't afford fine liquor. My how the proverbial tables have turned. Next time you're in bourbon country, be sure to try one of these classic southern libations.",1935

When the Napoleon House began serving Pimm's Cups, it was in an effort to prevent their clientele from completely inebriating themselves in the sweltering Louisiana summer heat. The Pimm's Cup originated in London though, where it is still drunk by the gallon in the summer. Pubs sell them by the pitcher, and at Wimbledon, over 40,000 pints of the stuff are sold within just two weeks.

There are many provocative theories about the origins of this cocktail, but most people agree that it was first created sometime in the 1930s at Harry's New York Bar in Paris.

In any case, the cocktail we now know as the Old Fashioned is said to have originated at the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky. Mixing drinks in the heart of bourbon country, it seems likely that the bartender would have used bourbon, but the Old Fashioned is also commonly made with rye whiskey for a drier and lighter cocktail. Several recipes call for muddled fruit and soda water, and there's nothing wrong with that per se. We prefer the more basic method though, as it really brings the whiskey to the foreground.",1935

Due to the tremendous technological advancements of the early 20th century, the Waldorf-Astoria quickly grew outdated and its wealthy clientele drifted elsewhere. Consequently, it was sold and demolished in 1929 to make way for the Empire State Building. The current Waldorf-Astoria was opened in 1931, but the Charlie Chaplin never seemed to make it back onto the cocktail menu. This bittersweet, fruity mixture is sure to satisfy any sweet tooth and pairs great with salty bar snacks.",1978

In case you haven't, here's a little background. Studio 54 was arguably the most famous nightclub in the world from 1977 to 1979. Located in Manhattan, this venue was a magnet for celebrities. Actors, artists, fashion designers, musicians; Studio 54 probably served at least one drink to nearly every famous name of the era that you can think of. And a good number of those drinks were likely Melon Balls. This cocktail packs quite a punch when it comes to flavor. Many recipes call for orange instead of pineapple juice, but the pineapple really highlights the bright, sweet flavor of the melon. The recipe can also be easily adapted to pitchers if you're hosting guests and drinks particularly well on the patio in summer. If you have a melon baller, try scooping out balls of honeydew and freezing them for ice.",1984

Jerry Thomas included a popular recipe in his 1862 book The Bartender's Guide and called it a Sour. Like Smashes and Flips, Sours can be made with any spirit, but whiskey is perhaps most common. Jerry Thomas's recipe did not include egg white, which is a common ingredient nowadays. The egg white was added later for froth and texture.

The bartender noticed that the couple had arrived in a brand new golden Cadillac and decided to make a drink to match it. This is the recipe he came up with.

In Ian Fleming's Casino Royale series, the Americano is the first drink ordered by the infamous James Bond himself.

Italian summers are heavily perfumed by the abundant number of peaches that grow throughout the country, and there is a long history there of marinating these succulent fruits in local wines. In 1948, Giuseppe Cipriani created the first Bellini at Harry's Bar in Venice in an attempt to transform his favorite fruit into a cocktail for his patrons. His invention was a huge success, but the Bellini remained a seasonal treat until a French entrepreneur devised a method of freezing the fresh peach puree so that Mr. Cipriani could serve them year-round.

Sometime in the mid-1700s, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon issued an order for rum to be mixed with his ship's water supply to keep it from spoiling. His trick worked, and became standard practice amongst many sailors. The name “Grog” is a nod to Vice Admiral Vernon, who was nicknamed “Old Grog” because of a grogram jacket he often wore.

As Rome conquered Europe, they continued expanding outward, eventually reaching the Iberian Peninsula, which is what we know as Spain and Portugal today. On their way, the Romans planted grapes to be able to make wine. At the time, water wasn't safe to drink, so it was a common practice to add alcohol, herbs, spices, and anything else that might kill of bacteria. The problem was that the table wine was so terrible that people would do anything to mask the flavor. This included adding fruit, juices, and even other types of alcohol to the wine in order to make it more palatable. Water may have since been made safe to drink, but the practice of making punch out of wine hasn't faded. Let's hope it never does.",1984

In the 1940s, the most common air route between America and Europe included a stop in Foynes, an air base near Limerick, Ireland. Given the temperamental nature of the weather in western Ireland though, short layovers often turned into overnight stays. On a winter's night in 1942, a particularly nasty storm sent a plane back to Foynes for the night. The restaurant was notified to prepare food and drink as usual, but chef Joe Sheridan decided to prepare something special for the passengers aboard the plane. Legend has it that one American passenger asked if he was drinking Brazilian coffee. “No,” Joe answered, “that's Irish Coffee.” Eventually, the recipe was discovered by travel writer Stanton Delaplane, who took it back to San Francisco with him, where it became a signature cocktail at the Buena Vista Hotel.",1960

The creator of this Yuletide brew was actually an Englishman by the name of Pierce Egan. He came up with the recipe and used it to promote a book he had authored and the subsequent stage play based on it. Contrary to what you might believe, the name is not a reference to MGM's animated cat-and-mouse duo, “Tom and Jerry”.

There are two main theories about the origin of this cocktail's name. The more poetic of the two comes from Tod's Well, which was Edinburgh's water source in the 18th century. The more plausible one, however, comes from the name for an Indian drink made from fermented sap of different types of toddy palm trees. These drinks were absorbed into the British Empire and adapted to British tastes. As with all cocktails of this straightforward style, there are myriad variations to be made.

Apparently, these guys really knew what they were doing. The club is still functional, and their punch is still delicious.

Not particularly good, but not too bad.” We respectfully disagree. This cocktail, first published in 1934 in Patrick Gavin Duffy's The Official Mixer's Manual, is a perfect balance of tart citrus and a sweet syrup, rounded out by a spicy rye. A great way to really savor the taste of the whiskey even if you're not in a neat or on-the-rocks kind of mood. The Blinker is an excellent choice for a winter cocktail, especially since everyone knows that grapefruit juice is good for fighting off a cold. If you're looking for variation, try substituting a quality raspberry syrup for the grenadine.",1935

Either way, this cocktail was first mentioned in print in the New York Times in 1908. Like many other drinks, there are countless variations on Planter's Punch. Many recipes don't even specify what fruit juices are supposed to be used. If you play around with it a bit, you will find that, like most punches, it is a very versatile drink that can work with any number of different flavor combinations. Also in keeping with its punch status, this is a great party drink and is easy to make in large quantities.",1935

It's one of the few drinks that are sure to bring out that warm, cozy feeling even though they're best served chilled. This cocktail isn't just a source of Yuletide cheer though. New Orleanians often drink it for brunch year-round, and it can be particularly refreshing after the occasional indulgent evening. In Colonial America, milk and brandy were thought to have strong medicinal properties. This tasty elixir grew quickly in popularity, and eventually people started drinking it for pleasure rather than for health—and who can blame them? Milk punch is like homemade ice cream, but better. If you have the supplies, opt for freshly grated spices. You will taste the difference.",1935

The first is its café color. The second seems to have something to do with people's penchant to replace after-dinner coffee with an after-dinner inebriant—not that we disapprove. This drink appears to trace all the way back to the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas's The Bar-Tender's Guide. At a time when the word cocktail invariably indicated the use of bitters, this drink was a misnomer in more ways than one. Still, it grew in popularity and eventually became a classic. The Coffee Cocktail makes a superb after-dinner drink, but can also serve quite well as an apéritif. And for those with a caffeine aversion, it is, of course, caffeine-free.",1957

The Singapore Sling is a variation on this theme that was developed at the turn of the 20th century by Ngiam Tong Boon, a bartender at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. If you visit the hotel today, you can actually see the safe where Boon stored his cocktail books. The Singapore Sling was taken off the hotel menu at one point and nearly forgotten. When the hotel wanted to revive it some time later, the bartenders had to rack their brains to remember the recipe. As is common with older cocktails, few people agree on how to make this one. Different recipes call for different fruit juices and even different liqueurs. Whatever your school of thought, this is a sweet, complex cocktail that you're sure to love.",1935

Bijou is French for jewel and was supposedly named because the colors of the three ingredients—gin, vermouth, and Chartreuse—resembled diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. This drink is packed with big, bold flavors typical of the pre-Prohibition era, but eventually fell out of popularity as American palates drifted toward simpler flavors. The original recipe, which calls for equal parts of the three ingredients, is wildly herbaceous in the most delicious of ways. If it's a little over the top for you, just ask your bartender to please dial back the Chartreuse and vermouth. This will yield a drier, more approachable flavor profile. If you're making your own, remember that dilution is key with a cocktail of this strength.",1935

The Gimlet was actually invented by naval surgeons for the British Merchant Navy to help prevent sailors from getting scurvy. In the past, the British were often referred to as “Limeys” due to their penchant for sucking on limes for vitamin C. But when Navy doctors began noticing that sailors were throwing theirs out, they concocted this refreshing little tipple to better ensure the health of their patients. Apparently a spoonful of sugar—and a couple of ounces of gin—really does help the medicine go down. The recipe eventually made it back to the mainland and is still an anchor on cocktail lists to this day. As for scurvy, it hasn't posed a real health threat in quite some time, but hey, better safe than sorry.",1984

The original recipe calls only for dry vermouth, but many people like to incorporate both dry and sweet vermouth to render it a little more approachable. The combination of rich, spicy Angostura bitters with bright, fruity orange bitters will impart a unique and complex flavor profile not found in most cocktails.
