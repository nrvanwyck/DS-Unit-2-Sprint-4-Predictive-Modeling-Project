0,44,Cocktail Glass,6 or more ounces,"This iconic glass with its V-shape and long stem  didn’t begin its career as a Cocktail glass at all, but rather for wine, punches, and later champagne. After Repeal came in 1933, the glass’s clean, geometrical lines fit the taste of the times and was used more and more until it drove out all other styles of cocktail glass. By the 1950s it meant “Martini,” the dominant cocktail of the day."
1,27,Old-Fashioned Glass,6 to 8 ounces,"The classic, single Old-Fashioned glass is the modern descendant of what was known in the mid-nineteenth century as the “small bar glass.” Heavy-bottomed and slant-sided, it held 5 to 6 ounces and was used both for mixing and for serving cocktails and other short drinks."
2,35,Sherry Glass,4 to 6 ounces,
3,21,Highball Glass,7 to 10 ounces,"When Americans started drinking Scotch whisky with soda and ice in the early 1890s, they didn’t invent a glass for it. Bartenders reached for the glass they were used to pouring soda into, the Fizz glass. Tall and narrow (so the bubbles would last), it held from 7 to 10 ounces—enough for a jigger of booze, a couple of ice cubes and a healthy squirt of soda, but not so big that the soda would drown the booze. Eventually, as Fizzes fell out of favor, the Highball hijacked the glass. "
4,3,Champagne Flute,6 to 8 ounces,"The champagne flute began its long career in Venice, at the end of the 1500s. A tall, slender, stemmed 6- to 8-ounce glass with gently incurving sides (nowadays, anyway; the original ones had a tight, tall v-shape), the champagne flute is excellent at displaying and preserving the wine’s bubbles. It’s less good, however, at opening up the wine’s aromas, and these days serious champagne aficionados are passing it over in favor of a variation of the tulip-style white wine glass."
5,33,Pousse-Café Glass, 1 ½  ounces,"By the end of the 19th century the Pousse Café had its own glass: still stemmed, but with the V of the sherry glass greatly tightened so that the glass wouldn’t hold more than 1 ounce—sufficient for a drink where the ingredients were measured in barspoons. The result is a small, narrow glass that perfectly shows off the layers of liqueur. The capacity varies, but the standard size is generally 1 ½ ounce."
6,13,Collins Glass,14 to 16 ounces,"The (genever-based) John Collins and the (gin-based) Tom Collins were among the hit drinks of the 1870s, and before long they had their own dedicated glassware: the “John or Tom Collins” glass is among the many types listed as essential for a bar to stock in Harry Johnson’s 1882 Bartenders’s Manual. Tall, narrow and straight-sided, the Collins glass is nothing more than a large Fizz or Highball glass -- the Collins was traditionally constructed on a rather more generous plan than those, and it’s dedicated glass usually holds 14 to 16 ounces."
7,31,Irish Coffee Glass,8 to 9 ounces,"Irish Coffee was introduced to America in the early 1950s. By 1958, it was so popular that it had its own dedicated glass. It is a version of the Sour glass with a little extra flare at the rim and a little ring-handle molded onto its side so you can hold it without burning your fingers. The standard size is 8 ½ ounces. "
8,38,Champagne Coupe,3 to 8 ounces,"The champagne coupe is, if anything, older than the flute. As a glass for champagne, it certainly dates back to the 1600s and was the dominant champagne glass well into the 20th century. Its wide, shallow bowl is terrible at retaining carbonation and its incurved sides do little to concentrate the wine’s aroma, but they are excellent at keeping the liquid within from sloshing out. It is found in a variety of sizes, from 3 ounces to 7 or 8 ounces. The most common sizes in bar use are around the 5-ounce mark."
9,26,Punch Cup,3 to 4 ounces,"The Punch cup has changed little since the 1840s when it was first popularized. It is a 3 to 4-ounce cut- or molded-glass cup with a little ring handle.  The handle, which gave the glass its nickname, “knuckle-trap,” helped to keep hot Punch hot and cold Punch cold. "
10,34,Red-Wine Glass,12 to 24 ounces,"In the late 19th century, the French began migrating to “balloon” or “tulip” glasses—more or less the style of the wine glass we know today, broad in the belly and narrow in the neck. This freed the aromas of the wine and concentrated them so that they could be appreciated. As a rule, glasses for red wine are larger than white-wine glasses, since white wine is generally served chilled, which inhibits the release of aromas. Red wine glasses can be as large as 24 ounces, even if only 4 to 6 ounces of wine will be poured into them. They should be at least 12 ounces to leave room for the aromas to concentrate. "
11,24,Beer Mug,10 to 12 ounces,"The beer mug is the modern descendent of the beer tankard, and that is very old indeed, dating back to the depths of the Middle Ages. Originally, tankards were made from clay, pewter, silver or even wood or leather, and they tended to be very large. Pint mugs and even larger mugs were made and sold, but the standard range was between 8 and 14 ounces and 10 or 12 ounces appears to have been the most common size, and it still is."

15,28,Beer/Pilsner Glass,10 to 18 ounces,"The pilsner glass is descended from the old beer flute, as used in the 1600s and 1700s. Tall and narrow, it displays the beer’s carbonation to excellent effect and allows for a good head. The glass didn’t get a lot of traction with American drinkers until the late 20th century, with the rise of imported beer. Sizes vary from 10 or 11 ounces to well over 20 ounces; it’s difficult to specify a standard here—some bars go with 10 ounces, others 22 ounces, and yet others 16-18 ounces. "

17,57,Hot Toddy,,
18,62,Whiskey Glass,,
19,63,Sour Glass,5 to 6 ounces,"In the middle of the 19th century, the Sour was a new drink, it went into the same small bar glass (see Old-Fashioned Glass) as Cocktails and other short drinks. Sours, however, began with a jigger of booze and then added citrus juice and a sweetener, and often a red wine float - and they wouldn’t fit into the standard Cocktail glass. Enter the Sour glass, a narrowish, 5- or 6-ounce glass with slanted sides."
20,30,Cordial or Pony Glass,2 to 3 ounces,"The cordial glass dates back to the very beginning of the 19th century when it became customary in gentle company to follow a meal with a few sips of curaçao, maraschino, crème de noyeau or some other rich, sweet liqueur.  Stemmed, as most elegant glassware was at the time, the cordial glass generally held 1 ounce or even 3/4 of an ounce."

28,36,Shot Glass,1 ½ to 2 ounces,"In the 19th century, if you ordered whiskey in a bar the bartender would put a glass of water in front of you along with a bottle of whiskey and a small but bulky 3 to 4-ounce tumbler with a heavy, fluted bottom. By the 1920s, the whiskey glass was largely phased out (for straight whiskey, at least) in favor of the 1 ½- to 2-ounce “shot glass.”"
29,70,Copper Mug,,
30,72,Metal Mug,,
31,37,White-Wine Glass,10 to 18 ounces,"For the history of the white wine glass, see the red wine glass. Being somewhat smaller than red wine glasses due to the need for less headspace to gather the aromas of the wine, white wine glasses tend to peak in size at about 18 ounces and should not be much smaller than 10 ounces. In either case, only 4 to 6 ounces of wine will be poured into them. "
32,25,Brandy Snifter,8 to 12 ounces,"In mid-19th century American slang, a “snifter” was a slug of straight spirits; eventually, it got transferred to the glass from which the spirit was sipped.  The glass is built wide, squat and short-stemmed, so that it will force the spirit to release the most aromas, with a short stem that forces one to hold the glass by cupping one’s hand around the bottom of the bowl, thus warming the spirit and releasing even more aromas. Snifters come in all sizes, from ridiculously tiny to gargantuan; the standard size, if there is one, is 8 to 12 ounces (of course, only 2 ounces or so of spirit is actually be poured into it).  "
33,32,Parfait Glass,8 to 12 ounces,"The Parfait glass is not used much in American bars but it does have its place. Imported from the soda fountain, where this tall, footed, flare-rimmed glass was used for various ice-cream concoctions, it finds bar use for certain fancy drinks, blender drinks and crushed-ice drinks, often with cream or ice cream in them and usually with elaborate garnishes. Sizes vary greatly—there are mini Parfait glasses, in the 2-3 ounce range, that are used mostly for Pousse-Cafés. Larger ones hover around 8 to 12 ounces. "
34,73,Sherbet Cups,,
35,74,Wine Glass,,
36,23,Hurricane Glass,14 to 20 ounces,"The Hurricane glass derives its distinctive shape from the hurricane lantern, known to campers everywhere. Take the glass chimney from the lantern, put a round bottom and a stem on it and flare out the rim a little and fill it with rum, citrus and passionfruit juice (roughly 20 ounces). That’s what Pat O’Brien’s did in New Orleans in the early 1940s. "
